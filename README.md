## Key Features

1. **Product Data**
    - **Product catalog**: Information about products available for sale, including attributes such as name, description, price, category, brand, stock quantity, and images.
    - **Product variations**: If your platform sells configurable products (e.g., different sizes, colors), you'll need to store data for each variation, such as SKU, size, color, and price.

2. **User Data**
    - **User profiles**: Information about registered users, including names, email addresses, shipping addresses, billing information, and account preferences.
    - **Authentication credentials**: Securely store user credentials (e.g., passwords, OAuth tokens) for authentication and authorization purposes.
    - **Order history**: Maintain records of users' past orders, including order details, payment information, and shipping status.

3. **Order and Transaction Data**
    - **Shopping carts**: Temporary storage of items selected by users for purchase before checkout.
    - **Orders**: Records of completed transactions, including order ID, products purchased, quantities, prices, shipping details, and payment information.
    - **Payments**: Data related to payment transactions, such as payment method, transaction ID, status, and timestamps.

4. **Inventory Data**
    - **Stock levels**: Information about the availability of products in your inventory, including quantities on hand, reserved quantities, and stock alerts.
    - **Warehouse locations**: If you manage inventory across multiple warehouses, track the location of products to optimize fulfillment processes.

5. **Content Data**
    - **Static content**: Store static content such as landing pages, FAQs, and terms of service to provide information to users.
    - **Dynamic content**: Support for dynamic content, such as blog posts, articles, or product reviews submitted by users.

6. **Analytics and Logging Data**
    - **User activity logs**: Record user interactions with the platform, including login/logout events, product views, searches, and purchases.
    - **Analytics data**: Capture metrics and analytics related to user behavior, sales performance, conversion rates, traffic sources, and marketing campaigns.

7. **Metadata and Configuration Data**:
    - **Categories and tags**: Organize products into categories and assign tags for filtering and search purposes.
    - **Shipping methods**: Configure shipping options, rates, and delivery methods available to users during checkout.
    - **Tax rules**: Define tax rates, exemptions, and jurisdiction-specific tax rules for calculating taxes on orders.

8. **External Integration Data**
    - **Data from third-party services**: Integrate with external services such as payment gateways, shipping carriers, and inventory management systems to exchange data and automate processes.
    - **API data**: Handle data exchanged with external APIs for features like geolocation, currency conversion, or real-time shipping rates.


Handling these diverse types of data effectively requires careful planning of database schema, data models, and data storage mechanisms. Additionally, implementing robust data validation, security measures, and compliance with data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR) is crucial to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and regulatory compliance.


### Building and running your application

When you're ready, start your application by running:
`docker compose up --build`.

Your application will be available at http://localhost:8080.

### Deploying your application to the cloud

First, build your image, e.g.: `docker build -t myapp .`.
If your cloud uses a different CPU architecture than your development
machine (e.g., you are on a Mac M1 and your cloud provider is amd64),
you'll want to build the image for that platform, e.g.:
`docker build --platform=linux/amd64 -t myapp .`.

Then, push it to your registry, e.g. `docker push myregistry.com/myapp`.

Consult Docker's [getting started](https://docs.docker.com/go/get-started-sharing/)
docs for more detail on building and pushing.
